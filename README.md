# VM_Runner
VM_Runner is a simple python script that allows you to easily run your virtual box virtual machines from and open an ssh connection to them.
Thats pretty much it but for those that know the pain of opening virtual box and starting a vm and then opening a terminal and typing ssh user@ip_address
this is a nice little time saver.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- VirtualBox installed
- Guest Additions installed on the VMs
- SSH server running on the VMs
